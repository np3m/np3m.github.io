        <h1>NP3M Code of Conduct and Policy</h1>
        <ol>
          <li>
            All participants in NP3M activities must conduct themselves
            in a professional manner that is welcoming to all
            participants and free from any form of discrimination,
            harassment, or retaliation. All participants are expected to
            treat each other with respect and consideration, creating a
            collegial, inclusive, and professional environment for our
            activities.
          </li>
          <li>
            Specifically, participants will avoid any inappropriate
            actions or statements based on individual characteristics
            including age, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender
            identity, gender expression, ability status, marital status,
            nationality, political affiliation, religion, immigration
            status, and educational background. Harassment includes but
            is not limited to inappropriate or intimidating behavior and
            language, unwelcome jokes or comments, unwanted touching or
            attention, photography without permission, sharing offensive
            images, and stalking.
        </li>
          <li>
            If a participant observes inappropriate comments or actions
            and personal intervention seems appropriate and safe, they
            should be considerate of all parties when intervening. In
            all cases, a participant observing violations of this code
            of conduct has a responsibility to report the violation to
            NP3M leadership, for appropriate action. Retaliation for
            complaints of inappropriate conduct will not be tolerated.
          </li>
          <li>In addition, all NP3M members are expected to abide by APS
            ethics guidelines, available
            <a href="https://www.aps.org/policy/statements/summaryethics.cfm">here</a>.</li>
          <li>All publications and research products by NP3M fellows
            which involve participation from NP3M fellows need to
            acknowledge the NP3M NSF grant (including the number
            21-16686). This includes all publications for which the
            work was either started or completed while the NP3M fellow
            was supported by the NP3M NSF grant.
          </li>
          <li>All NP3M working groups are open to all NP3M
            members.</li>
          <li>NP3M presentations should be uploaded to the <a href="http://dcc.np3m.org">DCC</a>.
          <li>All NP3M publications should be have a preprint
            number obtained from the 
            <a href="http://dcc.np3m.org">DCC</a> 
            for submission to the arXiv or
            the journal.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h1>DCC Help</h1>
        <p>
          Please see document <a href="https://dcc.np3m.org/NP3M-G2300001/public">NP3M-G2300001</a> forinstructions on uploading documents to the DCC and requesting preprint numbers.
        </p>

        <h1>Travel</h1>
        <p>
          Travel is managed by UTK. At least one month before your
          trip, contact Andrew to get approval. Then contact Paula
          Keaton at UTK. She will have you fill out a guest traveler
          worksheet (this step only needs to be done once per NP3M
          participant). Paula will need the dates you are
          traveling, the cities you are traveling from/to, the purpose
          of the travel, and a link to the conference website (if
          applicable). If you would like, she can purchase the flight
          and hotel with the UTK account before you travel, so that
          you do not need to wait for reimbursement. All travel is
          subject to UTK rules, so, for example, you cannot ask for a
          hotel which is more expensive than the Federal CONUS rate
          unless it is a hotel specifically designated by the
          conference.
        </p>
        <p>NP3M Fellows are expected to attend one APS-like meeting
          and one international meeting every year</p>
