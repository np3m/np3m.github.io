              Title: Constraining the Neutron Star EOS with quasiperiodic
              oscillations from short GRBs<br>
            </p>
            <p>
              Abstract: Gamma ray bursts (GRBs) are the most luminous
              electromagnetic events in the universe. Short GRBs,
              typically lasting less than 2 seconds, have already been
              associated with binary neutron star (BNS) mergers, which
              are also sources of gravitational waves (GWs). The
              ultimate fate of a BNS, after coalescence, is usually
              expected to be a black hole (BH) with 2-3 solar masses.
              However, numerical relativity simulations indicate the
              possible formation of a short-lived hypermassive neutron
              star (HMNS), lasting for tens to hundreds of
              milliseconds after the BNS merger and before
              gravitational collapse forms a BH. The HMNS is expected
              to emit GWs with kHz frequencies that will be detectable
              by third generation ground-based GW detectors in the
              2030s. I will present results from a recent analysis
              that revealed evidence for HMNSs by looking for kHz
              quasiperiodic oscillations in gamma-ray observations
              obtained in the 1990s with the Compton Gamma Ray
              Observatory.

            <p>
              Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae (like mergers, the
              focus area of NP3M), are astrophysical sites rich with
              extreme physics and multimessenger signals. In this
              seminar I'll give a brief introduction to supernovae and
              the multimessenger signals expected from them. I'll also
              discuss in more detail our recent investigations into
              the impact of the thermal dependence in the nuclear
              equation of state in core-collapse supernova
              simulations, including the impact on the neutrino and
              gravitational wave signal, black hole formation
              properties, and the impact on potential ejecta from
              failed supernovae.

              Title: Effect of Missing Physics on Tests of General
              Relativity with Gravitational Waves
            </p>
            <p>
              Abstract: The observation of gravitational waves has
              enabled us to carry out stringent tests of Einstein's
              general theory of relativity (GR) in previously
              inaccessible regions of strong gravity. No violation of
              GR has been found so far but the improved detector
              sensitivity will detect binaries in configurations which
              are never seen before and may reveal features that are
              different from GR. There were a couple of events in
              GWTC-3 that showed hints of GR deviation though further
              investigations are needed since the deviation could be
              due to the use of imperfect waveform models or poorly
              understood noise artifacts in the data. In this talk, I
              will discuss various causes that could potentially lead
              to a false GR violation and what we can do to mitigate
              them. I'll also show results from our recent study on
              the effect of missing eccentricity on tests of GR and
              how it led to false GR violations. The gravitational
              wave community has to exclude the possibility of such
              causes (like an eccentric binary) in order to make any
              claim of a GR violation. </p>

              neutrino transport on microphysics and ejecta in binary
              neutron star mergers
            </p>
            <p>
              Abstract: We present an extensive study of the effects
              of neutrino transport in 3-dimensional general
              relativistic radiation hydrodynamics (GRHD) simulations
              of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers using our
              moment-based, energy-integrated neutrino radiation
              transport (M1) scheme. We consider a total of 8 BNS
              configurations, while varying equation of state models,
              mass ratios and grid resolutions, for a total of 16
              simulations. We find that M1 neutrino transport is
              crucial in modeling the local absorption of neutrinos
              and the deposition of lepton number throughout the
              medium. We provide an in-depth look at the effects of
              neutrinos on the fluid dynamics and luminosity during
              the late inspiral and post-merger phases,
              out-of-equilibrium dynamics and the potential impact of
              neutrino absorption on mitigating bulk viscosity in the
              post-merger phase, the properties of ejecta and outflow,
              and the post-merger nucleosynthesis.

              Title: Angular momentum imprints in the Multimessenger
              signals of Accretion Induced Collapse of White Dwarfs
            </p>
            <p>
              Abstract: Studies have proposed accretion-induced
              collapse (AIC) of white dwarfs (WDs) as possible power
              engines of short GRBs with extended emission (sGRB+EE).
              Aware of the recent turmoil around GRB211211A (a known
              sGRB+EE) origins, we revisited the science case of AICs.
              In this talk, we will discuss the results of three
              models of WDs that collapse due to electron capture.
              Parameterized by their initial angular momentum, we
              study the influence of rotation in our AIC models. A
              careful characterization of the multi-messenger emission
              of these events will be discussed. With a particular
              focus on gravitational radiation, we will examine their
              gravitational wave (GW) morphology and their
              detectability in current and future ground-based GW
              detectors. We provide estimates of their electromagnetic
              and neutrino radiation profile and compare them against
              other supernova-like events. All our models are fully
              general-relativistic three-dimensional numerical
              simulations containing a moment-based neutrino radiation
              transport. The inclusion of magnetic fields is an
              undergoing extension of our work.

            <p>Title: Successful \( \nu\mathrm{p} \)-process
              in a core-collapse supernova
            </p>
            <p>Abstract: The origin of the solar system abundances of
              several proton-rich isotopes, especially \(
              ^{92,94}\mathrm{Mo} \) and \( ^{96,98}\mathrm{Ru} \) ,
              has been an enduring mystery in nuclear astrophysics. An
              attractive proposal to solve this problem is the \(
              \nu\mathrm{p} \)-process, which can operate in
              neutrino-driven outflows in a core-collapse supernova
              after the shock is launched. Years of detailed studies,
              however, have cast doubt over the ability of this
              process to generate sufficiently high absolute and
              relative amounts of various p-nuclei. These problems
              have only become more severe with the recent realization
              that the triple-alpha reaction rates are enhanced by
              in-medium effects. If that wasnâ€™t enough, a separate
              line of argument ruling out this process is based on the
              long-lived radionuclide \( ^{92}\mathrm{Nb} \) .
              Yet, I will give explicit
              examples of realistic physical conditions, in which all
              these difficulties are successfully overcome. I will
              then discuss some implications for the properties of the
              protoneutron star a few seconds into the explosion. Work
              with Amol Patwardhan (SLAC \( \rightarrow \) Minnesota) and Payel
              Mukhopadhyay (SLAC \( \rightarrow \) Berkeley).

              Title: Transport in Neutron Star Mergers
            </p>
            <p>
              Abstract: Neutron star mergers are one of the most
              exciting cosmic laboratories of our time. Neutron stars
              and their mergers present a unique opportunity for the
              investigation of fundamental matter described by the
              standard model of particle physics, nuclear physics, and
              even beyond the standard model physics. Only by
              improving the microscopic physics implemented in
              simulations of general relativity will we be able to
              decode the governing forces of nuclear and particle
              physics imprinted in the merger signal. In this talk, I
              will focus on the effects of chemical equilibration on
              neutron star mergers and the resulting bulk viscosity. I
              will present simulation results that take chemical
              equilibration in dense matter into account, which lays
              the groundwork for using transport as a tool to
              investigate dense matter in binary neutron star mergers.

                <p>Title: Supernovae: From Bounce to Breakout</p>
            <p>Abstract: Simulations of core-collapse supernovae
              (CCSNe) experienced consecutive leaps of progress in the
              last decade. I will summarize exciting results in CCSNe
              modeling that have informed accurate ab-initio prediction
              of stellar explosion. I will discuss the joint
              detectability of correlated neutrinos and gravitational
              waves from such events, which will illustrate the dynamics
              of the remnant neutron star, the morphology of the
              explosion, and global stellar instabilities. I will share
              late-time neutrino data for 100 axisymmetric simulations;
              showcase a new, two-dozen model suite of 3D simulations;
              illustrate an exotic - perhaps not uncommon - joint
              formation of a black hole with an exploding CCSNe; and
              finally, tease early simulations that couple core-bounce
              and explosion to shock breakout.
